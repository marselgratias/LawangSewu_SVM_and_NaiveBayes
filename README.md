# LawangSewu_SVM_and_NaiveBayes
This repository contains a sentiment analysis project focusing on Lawang Sewu Semarang, a popular tourist destination. The goal of this project is to analyze the sentiment expressed in online comments and reviews related to Lawang Sewu using two different machine learning methods: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes.

# Dataset
We have collected a dataset of comments and reviews from various sources such as social media, travel forums, and online review platforms. These comments encompass the experiences and opinions of visitors to Lawang Sewu Semarang.

# Methods
1. Support Vector Machine (SVM): SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. In this project, we use SVM to classify comments into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. We fine-tune the model to achieve the best sentiment classification performance.
2. Naive Bayes: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm that works well for text classification tasks. We apply Naive Bayes to classify comments into sentiment categories and compare its performance with SVM.

# The main outcomes of this project include:
Sentiment classification of comments as positive or negative.
Visualizations such as word clouds to represent the most common words associated with positive and negative sentiments.
